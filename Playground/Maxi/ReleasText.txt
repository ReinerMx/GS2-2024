## About the project
This project, developed as part of the Geosoftware II course (Winter Term 2024/25), aims to create a **web-based catalog** for **user-friendly discovery and retrieval of machine learning models** tailored to **Earth Observation (EO) datacubes**. Following the **STAC Machine Learning Model (MLM) extension**, the platform will enable users to search, explore, and download metadata and models for integration into workflows using tools like **PySTAC** or **RSTAC**. It serves researchers, geospatial professionals, and data scientists by addressing the challenges of model accessibility, metadata standardization, and community-driven contributions.
