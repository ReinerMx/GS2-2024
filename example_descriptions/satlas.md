#### 🔍 What’s Special About It?  
This model helps you identify **solar farm locations** across large-scale Sentinel-2 imagery. Designed for **sustainability projects** and renewable energy mapping, it enables confident segmentation at **high precision**.  

#### 🌍 Motivation  
Are you mapping clean energy infrastructure globally?  
With a **pretrained Swin Transformer** architecture, you can:  
- **Spot solar farms** efficiently, even in challenging terrain.  
- **Understand growth trends** of renewable energy installations over time.
